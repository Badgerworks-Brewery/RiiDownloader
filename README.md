# RiiDownloader
a patch for the wiishop channel that if you to buy a Wii Game (or game that can run on a Wii like the VC games) on the nintendo switch, it can then remotely/locally extract the data from your switch's files and send to your wii to be repackaged as a WAD (effectively reviving the channel for certain games)

# Summary:

Say you want to get mario 64 on the wii but you didnt originally buy the game so you cant redownload.
Now, what this idea basically saying:
Is that you buy the game on switch via 3d all stars (ik its no longer available but this is an example)
And once you have bought it, and legally own it
You go onto your wii and open this "patched" wii shop channel
You would be able to link ur nintendo account
Where it then looks at what games you own (like Playnite)
And sees if any were also on wii
Then it will take you to the redownload game page on the wii shop
It then finds the switch on your network and uses nxdump remotely
Nxdump then extracts the mario 3d all starts file, uses automated versions off modding tools to rip the mario 64 rom from it
It then either applies any free patches, or connects to the open shop channel and installs one of its fanmade n64 emulators
Then creates a mario 64 wad installed in the menu
That's the jist of it
