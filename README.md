# RiiDownloader
This is a patch for the Wii Shop Channel that transfers Wii games downloaded on the Switch to your Wii.

# How does this work?
Say you want to get (for example) mario 64 on the wii but you didnt originally buy the game so you cant redownload.
Now is where my idea comes in.
If you buy the game on switch (for example, Super Mario 3D All Stars) you go onto your wii and open this "patched" Wii Shop Channel where you would be able to link your Nintendo Account. The shop then looks at what games you own (like Playnite) and sees if any of the games you own were also on the Wii: then it takes you to the redownload game page on the Wii Shop Channel, it then finds the Switch on your network, uses nxdump remotely that extracts the game file, uses automated versions of modding tools to rip the game rom from it, then either applies any free patches or connects to the Open Shop Channel and installs one of its emulator and installs a forwarder on the HOME Menu. I know this is complicated, but it's worth a try!
